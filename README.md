This library tries to make manipulating CSV files a great experience.

![Example session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlumbroso/comma/master/example-screenshot.png)

## Features

Here are some of the features that `comma` supports:

- Robust autodetection of CSV parameters
(thanks to [`clevercsv`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV)) and
encoding (thanks to [`chardet`](https://github.com/chardet/chardet)).
- Single-line usage, `comma.load(...)`, no syntax to remember or parameters to tweak.
- Simple, Pythonic interface to access/modify the rows using standard `list` and
`dict` operations, i.e. `row[0]` and `row["street"]` are equivalent.
- Column slices using the header name, i.e. `table["street"]`.
- In-place editing of the dataset, including multiple lines.
- Opening files directly from an URL.

## Installation

If you use pip:
```shell script
pip install 'comma[autodetect,net]'
```
or if you use pipenv:
```shell script
pipenv install 'comma[autodetect,net]'
```

## Why?

Although Python, fortuitously, is
"[batteries included](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy)",
on occasion, some of the libraries end up being designed with APIs
that don't map well to what turns out to be the most common usage
patterns. This is what happened with the various `urllib` libraries,
incredibly powerful, but limiting users by its complexity---it was
not straightforward, for instance, to use cookies: One of several
problems that [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests) by
[@ken-reitz](https://github.com/ken-reitz) addressed. Indeed,
`requests` abstracts power beneath simplicity, smart defaults, and
discoverability.

For the CSV format, we are confronted with a similar situation. While
both the JSON and YAML formats have packages that provide, one-command
means to load content from files in those respective formats to a
nested Python object, for the CSV format,
[the standard library](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0305/) has
you use an iterator to access the data. Many details require significant
syntax change (for instance the difference between having lists or
dictionaries depends on the class that is used to read the file).

Since then, we also have several excellent libraries that, by providing
great auto-detection (of dialect, file format, encoding, etc.) allow
for hiding many details from the end user.

All this to say, `comma` will try to do exactly what you want
when you do:

```python
import comma
data = comma.load("file.csv")
data[0]["field"] = "changed value"
comma.dump(data, filename="file_modified.csv")
``` 

## Alternatives

Python is fortunate to have a lot of very good libraries to read/write
CSV and tabular files in general. (Some of these were discovered through
the excellent [Awesome Python](https://awesome-python.com/) list.)

- [`clevercsv`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV): An
  exceptional library by [@GjjvdBurg](https://github.com/GjjvdBurg),
  builds on statistical and empirical
  to provide powerful and reliable CSV dialect detection. However, it
  strives to be a drop-in replacement for the original Python `csv`
  module, and as such does not improve on the complex syntax. This
  library is [the culmination of serious peer-reviewed
  research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11242), and `comma` uses it
  internally to improve auto-detection.
  
- [`csvkit`](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit): This is a set of
  command-line tools (rather than a module/package) written in Python,
  to make it easier to manipulate CSV files. One of the highlights is
  a tool called `csvpy <file.csv>` to open a Python shell with the CSV
  data loaded into a Python object called `reader`, to quickly run
  some Python logic on the data. While it is technically possible to
  use `csvkit`'s internals in a project, this is not documented.
  
- [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas): An advanced data
  science package for Python, this certainly provides a powerful CSV
  (and more generally, table file) reader and parser. The API of the
  table object is very powerful, but you need to take the time to learn
  how to use it. This library is perhaps not ideal for file manipulations.

- [`pyexcel`](https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel): This library provides
  access to Excel and other tabular formats, including CSV, and various
  data sources (stream, database, file, ...). It emphasizes one common
  format-agnostic API, that instead has the user choose the data format
  (list, matrix, dictionary, ...).

- [`tablib`](https://github.com/jazzband/tablib/): This library was
  originally written by [Kenneth Reitz](https://github.com/ken-reitz),
  the creator who brought [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests),
  [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and many other goodies to
  Python---and then included in the [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/)
  collective. The focus of this library is on interoperating between many
  different file formats (such as XLS, CSV, JSON, YAML, DF, etc., ...,
  even LaTeX `booktabs`!). It seems to have a very high adoption rate
  because it is a dependency for many Jazzband libraries. The API is
  class-based rather than method-based. A companion library,
  [`prettytable`](https://github.com/jazzband/prettytable) focuses on
  pretty printing tabular data (including from a CSV file).

- [`tabulator`](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tabulator-py): This
  library provides a single interface to manipulate extremely large
  tabular data---and useful for files so large that they need to be
  streamed line-by-line; the library supports a broad array of formats
  including reading data directly from Google Spreadsheets. However
  this power means that reading a CSV file requires several operations.

Although not specifically restricted to Python, the
[AwesomeCSV](https://github.com/secretGeek/AwesomeCSV) resource is also
interesting.

### Miscellaneous

Although not specifically a Python library, nor designed to read/write CSV
files (but instead to compare them), [`daff`](https://github.com/paulfitz/daff)
is a really cool project: It provides a `diff` of tabular data [with cell-level
awareness](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-diff/).

Another unrelated project is [Grist](https://www.getgrist.com/), a spreadsheet
PaaS, which among other useful features, allows [the use of Python within
formulas](https://support.getgrist.com/formulas/).
